    <p>In January of 2022 I bought a $1000 1991 Ford Ranger to participate in events with a group caled the <a href="https://www.gambler500.com/" target="_blank">Gambler 500 <i class="fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square"></i></a>.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have gone through the truck from top to bottom, doing upgrades and learning a everything there is to know about it.
      <ul>
        <li>Explorer 8.8 rear axle swap, including regear and full rebuild, re-weld perches and shock mounts. Upgrade to stronger axle with disc brakes and limited slip differential.</li>
        <li>6" suspension lift. Design and fabricate drop brackets for front. Upgrade to lifted Chevy 63s (Craigslist) in rear, including hangers, shackles, and custom bushings.</li>
        <li>ABS drain pipe snorkel into stock airbox/filter</li>
        <li>Wire all lights to ambulance switch panel with relays</li>
        <li>General overlanding and trash-collecting upgrades: ladder rack, tool box, seat swap, tool kit</li>
        <li>General roadworthiness and maintenance items: wheel bearings, brakes, engine valvetrain work, etc.</li>
      </ul>
