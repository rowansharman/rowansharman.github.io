      <a href="http://www.olinbaja.org/" target="_blank">Olin Baja</a> is an entirely student-run project team that annually designs, builds, and races a rugged off-road vehicle at national competitions. The vehicle must perform well in specified dynamic events, be robust enough to stand up to a four hour endurance race, and be easy and fast to repair in the inevitable event of breakdowns during the endurance race. We also must be able to manufacture the vehicle in-house.

      I joined the team in 2017 as electrical subteam lead and started a project working toward development of a sensing and logging system for the vehicle. This process included coordinating the subteam members, speccing and testing sensors, batteries, and other hardware, designing a system architecture to connect multiple devices for display and logging, and lots of soldering and writing Arduino. I also put together a powerful driver-to-pit crew communications system, including managing FCC licensing. Toward the end of the season, I moved to more mechanical and fabrication tasks in order to get the car finished on time, including machining half of the gearbox and lots of assembly and troubleshooting.

      For the 2018-19 season I am the fabrication lead. During the design season I am working with the design lead to ensure that all parts are designed for manufacture, helping new members learn CAD and design, and working to maintain last year's vehicle as a test platform. I am also working with subteams on design at all levels and helping the new electrical lead continue development of last year's system. During build season second semester, I will be organizing fabrication and assembly.
