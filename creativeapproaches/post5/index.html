      Internet privacy, data acquisition, user tracking and profiling, and related issues are things I've been aware of for a while, but not particularly concerned about personally. At Olin, I'm surrounded by people who take a lot of this very seriously and enjoy talking about it. I generally try to be pretty careful with my personal data, but I've never really thought I have much to hide, certainly in regards to what I put on the internet at all. And, while ads are annoying, I've never seen myself as particularly susceptible to them. I got pretty good at ignoring them, and only started using an adblocker a few months ago. I still haven't sat down and tried to decide how I feel about the ethics of adblockers, it's not a black-and-white issue to me.

      After reading this, it seems naive even to me that I haven't been paying more attention. Even if I tell them virtually nothing, companies know everything about me. Google literally knows everywhere I've taken my phone since I got a phone three years ago. Facebook knows who I've talked to and what we said. Amazon knows exactly what I've bought and where I've sent it. And virtually all of it is "secured" behind five thin digits of security, or worse, my fingerprint. If I was arrested, the police could <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/05/iphone-fingerprint-search-warrant/480861/" target="_blank">force me to unlock my phone with my fingerprint</a> and subsequently charge me with an unrelated offence. But oh, the convenience. I can open my phone with a touch, and it can guess where I want to go, who I want to talk to, and even what I want to say to them.

      After reading this I'll definitely be doing more research on how to protect myself and what the internet already knows about me. I'll be rethinking some convenient tradeoffs, and talking to more people about advertising and who its victims and beneficiaries are.
