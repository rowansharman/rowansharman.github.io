      For this project, <a href="https://sportsracer48.github.io/2018-10-02-License/">Henry</a> and I made a piece vaguely in the style of James Bridle's <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywwba5/meet-the-artist-using-ritual-magic-to-trap-self-driving-cars">Autonomous Trap 001</a>. We noticed that Bridle's piece pokes fun at the lack of perspective a certain piece of technology (an autonomous car) has, as compared to a human driver. It simply cannot understand the lines of salt as anything but a primal rule to be followed. We chose to similarly break down a different piece of technology: copyright. Copyright at first doesn't really seem like a technology, but it was after all a human invention that seriously changed the way we deal with intellectual property.

      So we created a piece we're calling <i>License</i>. <i>License</i> consists of a photograph of the Eiffel Tower at night and adjacent copyright license, with a pencil hanging next to it. The original photographer, <a href="https://evan.new-schmidt.com/">Evan New-Schmidt</a>, has relinquished all rights to the photograph, and the license allows anyone who signs it to become the legal artist and/or owner of the piece, including for sale and/or distribution of the work. Legally, the photograph is in a complicated place. Photographs of the Eiffel Tower at night are <a href="https://www.toureiffel.paris/en/business/use-image-of-eiffel-tower">technically illegal</a> to distribute, so it theoretically shouldn't exist in the first place. Then Evan released it to us, and we released it to whoever cares to claim it. We intentionally provided a pencil with an eraser with which to sign the license so the ownership and authorship can be fluid. However, from a human perspective, no matter who signs the license it is clear that the photographer is still Evan, the overall work was put together by Henry and myself, and the license is just a heavily modified version of the MIT license.
