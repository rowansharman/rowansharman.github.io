      I'm afraid I'm a bad writer. I've always known this, but after reading this essay I feel more validated in my assessment. I'm a decent technical writer and I can even write an essay if pressed, but ask me to tell a story or write a poem and all bets are off. I've been cringing at my own clichés since high school English and filling writing requirements with technical classes whenever possible. I'm definitely not striving for literary fame, but I find that like the aspirational writers Ahmad has had to work with, I'm not really interested in improving – it's just not a skill I care to have. A lot of people take issue with me saying that out loud, but I'm not the type of writer Ahmad is talking about and that's not the point.

      To be honest I'm not really sure what the point is. It seems that Ahmad is aggressively impressing his idea of what isn't good writing on the reader, expressing his woe that no one believes him, and finally offering some minimally helpful foundational tips. He says he's trying to inspire bad writers to look at their writing more critically, but it seems to me that he's mostly venting and has given up hope that anyone he considers a bad writer will listen to him.

      I also dislike Ahmad's use of the term "bad writer." He makes judgements fast, and then identifies people as really nothing more than bad writers, not leaving much room for improvement. He doesn't tell any success stories, only stating his belief that bad writers can become good writers.
