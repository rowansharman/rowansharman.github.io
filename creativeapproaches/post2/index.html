      Neil Postman's first point in his talk <a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/materials/postman.pdf" target="_blank">Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change</a> is that there is always a tradeoff that comes with new technology. The project <i>Last Clouds</i> I believe is an examination of people's response to the tradeoff between the relatively new and powerful technology of satellite imagery and the "Here be Dragons" sense of mystery that is quickly being edited out of the world along with Google Maps' last clouds.

      I like the idea of combing a resource like Google Maps specifically for its tiniest flaws, flagging them, naming them, claiming them, and dedicating them. And as the resource updates, you can find the flaws that have been fixed, now pins on the map with no cloud under them. It reminds you that every day there's a little less adventure to be had in the world. I marked a cloud that I remember—a particularly complicated section of a long hike I did that's been clouded for years. I remember printing out the imagery before we left, but on that day we didn't even bother getting out the map—we knew it was too cloudy to see—so it became a different kind of adventure. One day soon though, they'll probably replace that imagery, and the next hikers will know what to expect.

      On another level, I really enjoy the personality the project brings to each cloud. Most of the clouds have pretty thoughtful names and dedications. I spent a long time clicking around on the map, and then in exploring the project site, started recognizing certain clouds. Finding a cloud, deciding what locational relevance it has to you, and naming it takes a while. It makes you wonder what the other names mean to the people who found those clouds. And by allowing the map to simply be fully anonymously editable, a sense of respect is instilled. People (I would assume) don't mess with others' clouds, even though anyone could literally delete the entire map at any time.
