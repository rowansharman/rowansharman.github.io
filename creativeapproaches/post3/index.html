      If, as Kurgan argues, all data is interpreted, any and all data available to us are already viewed through the lens of the interpreter—here also the collector—and must be treated as such. While I believe there is certainly a level of truth here, I'm not sure it's fair to say that every dataset is interpreted. It is definitely true that every (or almost every) dataset has certain biases built into its collection and that metadata should remain closely bound to the data, but by keeping those in mind, I think most datasets can be accurately reinterpreted to learn many things far from the interpretation of the collector, or even used to refute the conclusions of the collector.

      While collection biases exist in any dataset, I think it's unfair to disallow datasets from being objective at any level. I believe that datasets can have objective truth, so long as the metadata defining the collection remains intact and associated with the data. The satellite images, for example: it is true that, given the constraints of the technology, at the time when any given photographs were taken, the surface of the earth looked as reported by the satellite. Further interpretation from there, however must be done with caution and viewed with skepticism, as demonstrated by Kurgan's Colin Powell example.
