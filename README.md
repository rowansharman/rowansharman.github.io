This website is my ongoing attempt to catalog and showcase some of my projects.  
View it at [rowansharman.com](https://rowansharman.com?utm_source=github&wemail=gh)  
  
### Here are links to some of the resources I found most helpful during the process:
- [w3.css](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/)
- [Set up Jekyll on Linux](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#platform-linux) to preview your site locally (I wasn't able to get it to work on Windows)
- [This site](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) has a good introduction to Jekyll and liquid tags and layouts and stuff. Also look at [includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/)
- [GitHub's guide to setting up GitHub pages sites with custom domains](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/)
- [This gist](https://gist.github.com/cvan/8630f847f579f90e0c014dc5199c337b) shows exactly how to use [cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) to serve a GitHub pages site with a custom domain with HTTPS
- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) is pretty easy to set up
- Adding some [source tracking](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en) can be useful
- Once you have UTMs set up, [clean up your URL](https://wistia.com/blog/fresh-url)
  - Particularly note that the ```wemail``` parameter is cleared by wistia, but recorded as a page by Google Analytics ;)
