    <p>This was a team project built for the Olin course <a href="http://poe.olin.edu/" target="_blank">Principles of Engineering</a>. It is a 3D scanner which uses a 2-axis gimbal with an IR distance sensor mounted on it to scan a region and plot it into
      a plane as a heat map. I designed, 3D printed, and assembled the hardware, wrote Arduino code to scan an object and send data over serial, and wrote a Python program which reads the serial data, saves it, and plots it as a heat map.<br> The original
      repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/ljordan51/3Dscanner" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
